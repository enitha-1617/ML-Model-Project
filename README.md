# ML-Model-Project
This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline: preprocessing data, selecting the right model, implementing it with Scikit-learn, and evaluating accuracy. Improvisations include structured workflow, clear model choice, and future scope for tuning, feature engineering, and performance enhancement.
