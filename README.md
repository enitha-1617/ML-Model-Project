# ML-Model-Project
This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline: preprocessing data, selecting the right model, implementing it with Scikit-learn, and evaluating accuracy. Improvisations include structured workflow, clear model choice, and future scope for tuning, feature engineering, and performance enhancement.
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop("target", axis=1)   # replace 'target' with your target column
y = df["target"]

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Choose ML model
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
